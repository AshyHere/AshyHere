ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Ashik Suresh, but you can call me Ashy.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m particularly interested in Seattle, Washington, and the dynamic opportunities it offers.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Master's degree in Data Analytics in Business at Seattle Pacific University, Seattle, aiming to further develop my expertise in the field.

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m keen on collaborating on projects related to Data Analytics, leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at ashikashy89@gmail.com for any professional inquiries or collaborations.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun fact: Outside of academia and work, I'm a proficient polyglot, fluent in 6 languages, and enjoy piloting drones during weekends as a hobby.
